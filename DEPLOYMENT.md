# Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Deploy to Vercel

### 1. Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### 2. Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, add:
```
# Required for AWS integration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=us-east-1:your-pool-id
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name

# Required for Replicate integration
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_your_token

# Required for GitHub integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token
```

### 4. IAM Policy for Presigned URLs
For the application to access images from the private S3 bucket, the serverless functions (running on Vercel, for example) need permission to generate presigned URLs. You must create an IAM policy in your AWS account and attach it to the execution role for your Next.js application.

A sample policy is provided in `s3-presigned-url-policy.json`. Remember to replace `your-bucket-name` with your actual S3 bucket name.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
